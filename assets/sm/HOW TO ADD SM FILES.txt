Put both the .sm and .ogg in the same folder and put the folder in this folder. Launch the game and go into freeplay, it'll load into the song list.

Limitations:
- You can only use songs that have one difficulty, so if a song has more than one. Remove all but the one you want to play. (it doesn't matter if it's challenge or what ever)
- The song must be a .ogg
